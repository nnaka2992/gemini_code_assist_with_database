# Gemini Code Assist with Database - Tech Verification Repository

This repository is dedicated to technical verification and exploration of Gemini Code Assist capabilities with various database technologies.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a testing ground for:
- Evaluating Gemini Code Assist's ability to work with database-related code
- Testing code generation for different ORMs and database libraries
- Verifying best practices implementation in database access patterns
- Exploring integration capabilities with various database systems

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains a different technology verification project:

### `/prisma-typescript`
- **Technology**: Prisma ORM with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: Verify Gemini Code Assist's capability to generate Prisma schemas, migrations, and TypeScript code

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions and requirements.

## Technologies Explored

- **ORMs**: Prisma
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript

## Contributing

This is a verification repository. Each new technology exploration should:
1. Be contained in its own directory
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Demonstrate both basic and advanced use cases
4. Include proper error handling and best practices
